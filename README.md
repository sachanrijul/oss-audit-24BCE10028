## 📂 Script Inventory

| Script File | Name | Description & Concepts Utilized |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `script1.sh` | **System Identity Report** | Generates a system welcome screen detailing the OS distribution, active kernel, logged-in user, and GPL licensing. <br>*(Concepts: Variables, Command Substitution, Output Formatting)* |
| `script2.sh` | **FOSS Package Inspector** | Scans the local system using `dpkg` to verify if the `apache2` server is installed, outputting a custom philosophical summary. <br>*(Concepts: if-then-else, Case Statements, Grep Piping)* |
| `script3.sh` | **Disk & Permission Auditor** | Iterates through an array of critical system directories (including Apache's config) to audit storage size, ownership, and permissions. <br>*(Concepts: For Loops, Arrays, Awk text processing)* |
| `script4.sh` | **Log File Analyzer** | Parses the Apache `error.log` file to count specific warning/error keywords and outputs the most recent occurrences. <br>*(Concepts: While-Read Loops, Command-line Arguments, Integer Math)* |
| `script5.sh` | **Manifesto Generator** | An interactive script that prompts the user for input regarding their FOSS philosophy and generates a personalized `.txt` manifesto. <br>*(Concepts: User Input (read), File Redirection, String Concatenation)* |
